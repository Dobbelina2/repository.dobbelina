Can you create a yaml script that syncronizes 2 folders on github, heres is the folder structure:
repository: dobbelina/repository.cumination
          ref: main
repository: dobbelina/repository.dobbelina
          ref: master
repository.cumination is private
repository.dobbelina is public
plugin.video.cumination is the name of the folder in both repositories
The syncronization should take place at a push event
